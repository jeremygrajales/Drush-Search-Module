# Drush-Search-Module
A drush command that allows you to search drupal.org for a module from your cli.

## Usage
drush search-module "some query"
drush sm views
drush sm "feed importer"

## Future
###Paging
I would really like to add paging capabilities to this so that the user can view multiple results pages.
###Module Descriptions
Module descriptions might also be useful in the results as well as other metadata such as release info such as that returned from drush pm-release.
